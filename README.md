# Project README

## Overview

This project enhances data fetching capabilities across components using custom hooks and Axios for efficient AJAX requests.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **PlayingCardList Component**

- Initialized an empty array in component state.
- Implemented AJAX requests using Axios to fetch data and populate the array.
- Refactored data fetching logic into a reusable custom hook called `useAxios`.
- `useAxios` accepts a URL and returns an array of fetched data and a function to add new data objects.

### 2. **Custom Hook: useAxios**

- Created `useAxios` to handle data fetching from APIs.
- Parameters:
  - `baseUrl`: Base URL for the API endpoint.
  - `initialData`: Optional parameter for initial data setup.
- Returns:
  - `responseData`: Array of fetched data.
  - `addData`: Function to add new data objects to `responseData`.

### 3. **PokeDex Component Integration**

- Integrated `useAxios` into the `PokeDex` component.
- Adapted `useAxios` to handle dynamic endpoint URLs based on Pokemon names.
- Ensured compatibility with `PlayingCardList` while maintaining separate endpoint configurations.

## Next Steps

- Expand `useAxios` to support more dynamic endpoint configurations and error handling.
- Enhance component testing to validate data fetching and state management.
- Explore optimizations like caching and pagination for large datasets.

## Conclusion

The project showcases effective use of custom hooks and Axios to streamline data fetching across components. The modular approach ensures scalability and maintainability, setting a solid foundation for future enhancements.
